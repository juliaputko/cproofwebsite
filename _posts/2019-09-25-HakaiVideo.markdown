C-PROOF partners [Hakai Institute](https://hakai.org) worked with us to create this great video documenting our glider deployments this summer.

The also made this great [blog post](https://hakai.org/blog/ocean-gliders-live-on-the-bc-central-coast/).

We were at Calvert Island in the Great Bear Rainforest testing our glider fleet in partnership with Hakai in a deep canyon just offshore of the island.  The tests were very successful, and we are hoping to continue our partnership with Hakai and do more work this coming spring, starting in April 2020. The long-term goal is a continuous line from Calvert Island to the shelf break to observe how the ocean and Queen Charlotte Sound interact and how transport and mixing drive productivity in the region, and how that may change in the future.
