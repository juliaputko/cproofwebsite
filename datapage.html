<h2>Data Description</h2>

The different types of data files that are available are named as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Realtime: Subset of data transmitted via Iridium while the glider is in mission, with basic automated processing steps and QA/QC applied. </li>
    <li>Delayed: Full dataset collected by the glider and recovered post-mission, with all processing steps and QA/QC applied. </li>
    <li>Level 0 (L0) data: Merged raw data files, with no interpolation and no processing. </li>
    <li>Level 1 (L1) data: Time series or profile data with some interpolation and calculation of additional variables like salinity. </li>
    <li>Level 2 (L2) data: Gridded level 1 data, on a depth-time grid. </li>
</ul>
