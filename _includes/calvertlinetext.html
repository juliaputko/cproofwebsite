In August of 2021, C-PROOF completed a first year of sustained ocean glider missions in Queen Charlotte Sound along the
 “Calvert Line”. This is the first successful attempt to obtain sustained, high-resolution 
 oceanographic observations across this wide shelf in both summer and winter despite a 
 pandemic, rough weather conditions, strong tides, complex bathymetry and instrument failures. 
 In each survey, a glider transversed from the coast to the open ocean: east to west along Goose 
 Trough past the shelf break and back to its deployment location, covering around 500 km over-ground 
 in a 3-4 week time span.
